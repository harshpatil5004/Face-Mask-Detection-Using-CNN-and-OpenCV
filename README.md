# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-CNN-and-OpenCV
This project implements a CNN model to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not, using OpenCV for real-time face detection. The model is trained on images with and without masks, offering accurate classification. It can be integrated with webcams or video streams for monitoring mask compliance in public spaces, and healthcare enviorment.
